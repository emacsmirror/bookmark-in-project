This is done without adjusting trailing slashes or following links."

  ;; Notes:
  ;; - This is loosely based on `f-same?'` from the `f' library.
  ;;   However it's important this only runs on the user directory and NOT trusted directories
  ;;   since there should never be any ambiguity (which could be caused by expansion)
  ;;   regarding which path is trusted.
  ;; - Avoid `file-truename' since this follows symbolic-links,
  ;;   `expand-file-name' handles `~` and removing `/../' from paths.
